# VARIABLES

A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are declared
 using var followed by the variable's name.

Here's an example:

var example;

The above variable is declared, but it isn't defined (it does not yet reference
a specific value).

Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific value:

var example = 'some string';

# NOTE

A variable is declared using var and uses the equals sign to define the value th
at it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable equal a value
".

## The challenge:

Create a file named variables.js.

In that file declare a variable named example.

Make the variable example equal to the value 'some string'.

Then use console.log() to print the example variable to the console.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

## javascripting verify variables.js
