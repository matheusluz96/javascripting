# INTRODUCTION

To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.

Run this command to make a directory called javascripting (or something else if
you like):

mkdir javascripting

Change directory into the javascripting folder:

cd javascripting

Create a file named introduction.js:

touch introduction.js or if you're on windows, type NUL > introduction.js (type
is part of the command!)

Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

console.log('hello');

Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this comm
and:

javascripting verify introduction.js
