# FUNCTIONS

A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and then p
roduces output.

Here is an example:

function example (x) {
  return x * 2;
}

We can call that function like this to get the number 10:

example(5)

The above example assumes that the example function will take a number as an arg
ument –– as input –– and will return that number multiplied by 2.

## The challenge:

Create a file named functions.js.

In that file, define a function named eat that takes an argument named food
that is expected to be a string.

Inside the function return the food argument like this:

return food + ' tasted really good.';

Inside of the parentheses of console.log(), call the eat() function with the str
ing bananas as the argument.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

javascripting verify functions.js
